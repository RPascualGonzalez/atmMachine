We want to build an ATM machine and the first thing we need to do, is to create the software that will breakdown which bills (notes) and coins to give you when you are trying to make a withdrawal.

initial ATM state:

 

| Value | Type | quantity of units |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| 500   | bill | 2                 |
| 200   | bill | 3                 |
| 100   | bill | 5                 |
| 50    | bill | 12                |
| 20    | bill | 20                |
| 10    | bill | 50                |
| 5     | bill | 100               |
| 2     | coin | 250               |
| 1     | coin | 500               |
